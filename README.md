**Interactive social media nav with tooltip transformation**

- Transformed the social media nav into an elegant tooltip for desktop.
- Used CSS positioning for precise tooltip placement.
- Implemented the smooth transitions and the "speech bubble" triangle effect with borders.
- Manage active states for the share button using JavaScript class toggles.
